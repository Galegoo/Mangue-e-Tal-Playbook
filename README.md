My first professional project and first of my projects to be on Play Store, the application was carried out by Recife Secretariat of Environment and Sustainability, in partnership with Recife's City Hall and the Catholic University of Pernambuco. The app is a digital comic book that contains 5 minigames added to it's story.

The app was developed to run on Android, was distributed on Recife's Metropolitan Region education network's tablets but unfortunately it was removed from the Play Store for political reasons, so I adapted it as much as possible and made it available on Itch.io to make it easier to view.

The games are a Point and Click investigation Game, a Memory Game, a Top Down Runner (this one sadly doens't work on WebGL), a Lever Puzzle and a Flappy Bird like game.
